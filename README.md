### rCharts Plugin to Interactively Plot glm Models

See @benjh33 [post](http://mostlyconjecture.com/2014/06/30/linear-models-with-rcharts-and-d3/) for a writeup with code and examples.

While this is currently experimental, this plugin is a great example of a relatively easy way to plot coordinated interactive [`d3.js`](http://d3js.org) charts straight from R with [rCharts](http://rcharts.io).  The reference classes for this and other plugins are in [plugins.R](../plugins.R) in the parent directory.
