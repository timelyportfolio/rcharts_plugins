### rCharts Plugins

See @benjh33 [posts](http://mostlyconjecture.com/blog/) for a multiple writeups with code and examples.

While these are currently experimental, these plugin are great examples of a relatively easy way to plot coordinated interactive [`d3.js`](http://d3js.org) charts straight from R with [rCharts](http://rcharts.io).  The reference classes for this and other plugins are in [plugins.R](../plugins.R) in the parent directory.
